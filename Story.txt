Atharva and Twinkle are planning to go catch pokemon. They run into a very small pokemon that they cannot catch so they chase it and they get lost in forest. They try to get out of teh forest and then they find a lengendary pokemon that's so strong and that pokemon helps Atharva and Twinkle to get out of the forest. And then they found another interesting pokemon and start chasing and they didn't learn from their mistake.
